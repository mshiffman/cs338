##would not let me copy the info section from the wireshark window
1 192.168.64.2 129.6.15.28 TCP 60852->13 [SYN] Seq = 0 Win = 32120 .... 
2 129.6.15.28 192.168.64.2 TCP 13-> 60852 [SYN, ACK] Seq = 0 Ack=1 Win=65535 ...
3 192.168.64.2 129.6.15.28 TCP [ACK] Seq =1 Ack=1 Win=32128 Len = 0

2)
Uses port number 60852

3)
Since the TCP connection is a two-way handshake, the server must know the client port number in order to communicate back with the client.

Synchronization Packet and Acknowledgment 

6)
nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection as it is the client ip address that is the source for the first [FIN].

===== HTTP =====
1)
Would only load 2 TCP connections if I used a normal window and would flag errors and not fully load the webpage but when I used a private window had hundreds of TCP connections? When I hit the stop button I was at 566 frames. Could tell that there were two TCP connections originally as different lines showed the differennt components of the handshake like [SYN] and [ACK]

2)
Yes, could tell where the homepage was requested because of the GET HTTP line in the wireshark window.
28 192.168.64.2 172.233.221.124 HTTP GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3)
Yes, could tell because fo the GET HTTP line in the wireshark window.
32 192.168.64.2 172.233.221.124 HTTP GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====
Why when I tried to load the webpage in the normal firefox browser lines would be highlighted in red and it would not load? Also why when I would load the webpage in the private firefox browser it loaded hundreds of frames?
